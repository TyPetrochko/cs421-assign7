 - Remove dummy code in semant.sml
 - Remove weird print statement from main.sml
 - Write "string function"
    -> Mentioned in main.sml, cooks static data in place
 - Make sure we pass a liveness temp list into procEntryExit
 - For munchStm, lookup registers in actual table (see TODO around line 67 in codegen.sml)



Stuff to do now!
  - a lot of munchStm's are backwards!
  - add a call expression
  - in procEntryExit, we first allocate frame space for:
      ALL PSEUDO-REGISTERS
      LOCAL VARS
      CALLEE-SAVES
      MAX ARGS
  - We need to save all the callee-save registers at the beginning, then
  return them at the end!
  - call genSpills!!!! in procEntryExit
