 - Remove dummy code in semant.sml
 - Remove weird print statement from main.sml
 - Write "string function"
    -> Mentioned in main.sml, cooks static data in place
 - Make sure we pass a liveness temp list into procEntryExit
 - For munchStm, lookup registers in actual table (see TODO around line 67 in codegen.sml)



Stuff to do now!
  - figure out what to put in register.sml
  - figure out what procEntryExit does
  - start implementing them
  - finish munch!
