This version produces correct x86 code, but there are a few bugs/kinks I'm
working out to get it compiling. These are documented in codegen.sml.

<ii>

To use this, copy the CodeGen folder to your own directory and glue everything
together inside main.sml.

<iii>

My assumptions are that everything can be done using 20 pseudoregisters, and
the ItreeGen and RegAlloc are fully functional and bugless.

<iv>

Nothing new, see README.6c.

<v>

None.
